# Ez3D
## 3D printed parts for a rocket that flies on A thru C motors

# Parts List:
1. Ez3D-1850-4 Fin Can
2. BT50 Nose Cone
3. 18mm Retainer Cap
   - Print out the multiple sizes (No scaling, +3%, +5%), These account for different printing tolerances and post flight shrinking.
4. BT50 3D printed Launch Lug assembly
5. Nine (9) inches of BT-50 type body tube
   - A standard 18 inch tube makes two kits
   - 3D printable tube cutting guide included in repository files
6. Three (3) feet of Kevlar string for Recovery Harness
   - Flight tested on 9KM DWLIFE Black Braided Kevlar Cord (1.3mm, 300 lb) but others may work
7. Twelve (12) inch parachute (Streamer can also be used but it descends fast)
8. Two (2) inches of BT-20 type body tube (Optional)
    - This tube serves as an Insulator between the motor and Fin Can
    - Use of Insulator helps reduce Fin Can heat shrink after each launch
9. Tape

# Assembly: 

1. Tie Recovery Harness to hole in Fin Can
2. Thread Recovery Harness thru Body Tube
3. Slide Body Tube onto top of Fin Can
4. Tape Body Tube to Fin Can - avoid blocking integrated launch lug
5. Tape Launch Lug Assembly midway up Body Tube
6. Tie loose end of Recovery Harness to Nose Cone
7. Attach parachute to Recovery Harness

**NOTE: Individual printers and filament have different tolerances** <br />
**- Fit check items before assembly. Options to adjust if necessary:**
- Add tape to increase diameter
- Remove material by sanding
- If your printer has a scaling feature, use it to adjust the part size
- Change the dimensions in the FreeCAD file available

# Launch Preparation:
1. Insert 1 or 2 squares of recovery wadding into Body Tube
2. Load Recovery Harness and Parachute into Body Tube
3. Place Nose Cone on top of Body Tube - ensure slightly snug fit
4. Slide BT-20 insulator into Fin Can before motor (Optional)
5. Load motor into Fin Can
    - Motor will fit loosely if BT-20 insulator is not used
    - Loose fit is not an issue with proper motor retention
7. Screw Motor Retention Cap onto base of Fin Can
   - Depending on your printer, the larger sizes may fit better
   - After a flight or two, the smaller size may fit better
9. Launch using standard model rocket procedures

# Recommended motors and expected performance: 



A8-3         = ~150 ft  (Optimum delay = 2.9 s)

B6-4         = ~300 ft (Optimum delay = 4.3 s)

C6-5         = ~600 ft (Optimum delay = 5.3 s)


# IMPORTANT POST FLIGHT NOTES:
- 3D printed material shrinks after cooling down from heat of motor
- Removal of motor may be difficult or impossible after one or several flights
- The smaller motor retainer cap may fit better after the first flight
- If existing motor retainer caps no longer work, friction or tape may suffice for retention
- PLA filament most suspectable to shrinking. Others may last longer.

## Entire kit fits in a gallon sized ziplock bag!
